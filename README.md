# URL-shortener
URL shortener in Python using the Flask web framework.

To run this script, you'll need to install the Flask package by running pip install flask. Once installed, save the code in a file, for example url_shortener.py, and run the script with python url_shortener.py. This will start a local web server where you can access the URL shortener in your browser.
